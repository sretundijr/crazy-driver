# crazy-driver

A mobile app using the device accelerometer.

The goal of this app is to build experience with react native and expo.  This app isn't
intended to be released due to liability.

The current plan is to use the device accelerometer as well as GPS for client side.
The plan for the API is to store basic user data and high scores

Scoring system: as of right now the scoring system is based on acceleration data and time. The plan is to manipulate the score based on time. Since acceleration data is almost continuous a large score can be achieved by simply driving around. By increasing or 
decreasing the score by time, the app will return a more accurate representation of 
just how crazy a driver really is.
